  人的生命里有一种能量，它使你不安宁。说它是欲望也行，幻想也行，妄想也行，总之它不可能停下来，它需要一个表达形式。这个形式可能是革命，也可能是爱情；可能是搬一块石头，也可能是写一首诗。
只要这个形式和生命力里的这个能量吻合了，就有了一个完美的过程。</p>

一个彻底诚实的人是从不面对选择的，那条路永远会清楚无二地呈现在你面前，这和你的憧憬无关，就像你是一棵苹果树，你憧憬结橘子，但是你还是诚实地结出苹果一样。
西方爱情是强烈开放的花朵，东方爱情是两朵花之间微妙的芳香。</p>

自由并不是你不知道干什么好，也不是你干什么都可以不坐牢；自由是你清楚无疑你要干什么，不装蒜，不矫揉造作，无论什么功利结果，会不会坐牢或者送死，都不在话下了。对于惶惑不知道干什么的人来说，自由是不存在的；对于瞻前顾后、患得患失的人来说，自由是不可及的。

一个人，生活可以变得好，也可以变得坏；可以活得久，也可以活得不久；可以做一个艺术家，也可以锯木头，没有多大区别。但是有一点，就是他不能面目全非，他不能变成一个鬼，他不能说鬼话、说谎言，他不能在醒来的时候看见自己觉得不堪入目。一个人应该活得是自己并且干净。
命运不是风来回吹，命运是大地，走到哪里你都在命中。</p>

贾宝玉是真性情，鲁智深也是真性情；鲁智深一句唱词儿“赤条条来去无牵挂”，贾宝玉眼泪就下来了，顿时就有了感觉。可是你让贾宝玉抡个棍子去打，那无疑是找死。他们爱好不同，性情很不一样，但是呢，都是真性情，它就通了。
从叶到花，或从花到叶，于科研是一个过程，而于生命自身则永远只在此刻。花和叶都是一种记忆方式。果子同时也是叶子。生命是闪耀的此刻，不是过程，就像芳香不需要道路一样。

我到了新西兰一个小岛上，把身体交给了劳动。四年之后，有一天，我忽然看见黑色的鸟停在月亮里，树上的花早就开了，红花已经落了满地。这时候我才感到我从文化中间、文字中间走了出来。万物清清楚楚地呈现在你的心里，一阵风吹过，鸟就开始叫了，树就开始响了。
这个时候我明白了一个道理：只有在你生命美丽的时候，世界才是美丽的。</p>

  I.	Introduction
A.	Attention Getter

If you went to movie you were excited to see and then found out it was awful, would you sit and suffer or just walk out?  If life starts to become a painful movie, would you like to wait until the end?

B.	Audience Relevance

Nobody can stop getting old, it’s a sad fact. We all will have a day to leave the world. But not everyone dies with dignity. I believe everyone can has the right to face the end with dignity, rather than struggle with painful illness until the last moment.
 
C.	Speaker Credibility

As a college student who is very concerned about this social issue, I’ve read a lot of real-life cases and analyzed relevant research. Today, I want to be a voice for the process of the right to die.

D.	Thesis

 With the appropriate supervision, the legalization of the right to die not only meets the urgent needs of patients suffering from serious diseases but also promotes the progress of human rights and ideology in society.         

               E．Preview

       
First, I will point out the social problems brought about by the lack of  right to die.         
   Second, I will analyze the causes of these problems.          
Thirdly, I will introduce an organization that promotes this right. 

Transition to first main point
                      Now, let’s get started with the problems we have to face in our society.

II.	Body
Main Point 1: The absence of the right to die not only makes patients suffer but also a deficiency of human rights.
1.	Subpoint 1: 
According to the website named very well health updated on October 14, 2018, “35 percent of patients describe their pain in the last week of life as severe. …  With cancer, 90 percent of people experience pain, and half of the people dying from cancer have severe pain.”         
This phenomenon really arouses my concern, what could we do for the people who can't really take the suffering?  Death is inevitable, but what about suffering?  What about letting them have the right to end their own life?


2.	Subpoint 2
Unfortunately, patients’ severe pain didn’t arouse many concerns and discussion about the right to die. Fox News conducted a survey on Oct.2005, in the question "Do you think terminally ill patients could have the right to end their lives?", 52% of people answered yes while 37 % said no.   However, only a few countries such as Netherlands Germany and Switzerland have published relevant laws on the legalization, 
the process of making relevant laws is going very slow. 


       Transition 
Since we have already understood the existing problems, let’s take a look at what caused the debate of right to die.

B.	Main Point 2: Understandably, there are people who are passionate about the issue of the right to die; both to advocate for it and also to advocate against it.
Subpoint 1: 
Some people suffer from terminal illnesses and the existing medical technology and medicines cannot help them.  More to the point. According to Atlantic: “Despite programs across the country, the number of Americans experiencing chronic pain in the last year of life increased by nearly 12 percent, and depression in the last year of life increased by more than 26 percent”  .  Thus, some people argue that modern medicine system can't even be helpful to alleviate some chronic pain, how can it be helpful to some end-of-life patients who suffering from both physical and mental depression?

Subpoint 2: 

Other people hold their point of view that the legalization of this right is not supposed to be applied widely, and they worry that it would be applied against a person’s will. Without a complete system, “there is a risk people will feel more inclined to ask for it”, as is explained in CBS news, "In Netherlands, patients are now more willing to ask for assistant suicide and doctors are more willing to grant it, however, some of them are not having a life-threatening illness.”     


Transition: Understanding the major opinions on both sides, we should move on to what I believe is necessary to advocate for people in this position and what the legal process should be. 
C.	Main Point 3:  Establishing a sound legal system for this issue is important to help people who really  need the freedom to choose what their final days will be like. 
1.	Subpoint 1:
 In my point of view, the organization such as Death with Dignity National Center can shape the future. According to their official website, “The mission of the Death with Dignity National Center is to promote death with dignity, to provide an option for dying patients and to help improve the end-of-life care.” . 

2.	Subpoint 2: 
What’s more, in the FAQ page of the website, the organizers showed their respect to moral principles. In order to avoid its abuse, they support strict control of the right which includes the Oregon Death with Dignity Act. In this regulation, to be qualified in death with dignity, a person must be:
First, mentally competent
Second, having a terminal disease 
Third, capable of making a decision.
Through the regulation, the organization not only provides help to patients suffering from illness but also can meet ethical principles.
Transition and signal closing
 I don’t know how you see this issue, but hopefully as we approach the end of the speech, you’ve at least considered my opinion carefully. 
III.	Conclusion
A.	Restate Thesis
 Under the supervision of the law, the right to die can bring the final dignity and peace to everyone in society.
B.	Review Main Point


We have seen that countless lives suffering and dying in the fight against the disease. 
We have seen that the controversy has made the process of legalizing the right to die didn’t change a lot in many years. 
We see that organizations like Death with Dignity t are making voices for the urgent needs of patients.
C.	Memorable Closer
In current society, it is universally acknowledged that we should respect personal choice. We chose to be a student, we chose to be a member of the family, we chose to be a part of the community, we chose to be alive. I really hope someday people will be able to choose what their final days will look like.  Because: 
“To be or not to be, that is a question”. And for this question, everybody can have their own answer.
